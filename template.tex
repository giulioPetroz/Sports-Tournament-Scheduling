\section{SAT Model}
This part is mandatory for groups of 4 students. Groups up to 3 students can choose between SAT and SMT, and will be given bonus points if they do both.

\subsection{Decision variables}
Describe all the literals of your model and their semantics. For example, $\Delta_{i,j} = \text{true}$ iff the driver goes from city $i$ to city $j$.

\subsection{Objective function}
See Section 2.2. Explain how you managed to do optimization in SAT.

\subsection{Constraints}
Describe all the clauses of your model and their semantics. In particular, describe the encoding(s) that you used. Follow the indications given in Section 2.3 for main problem constraints, implied constraints, and symmetry breaking constraints.
\subsubsection{Every team plays once a week}
\subsubsection{Every team plays at most twice in the same period}
\subsection{Validation}
See Section 2.4. The model \textbf{must} be implemented using at least Z3. Bonus points will be considered if a solver-independent language (e.g., Dimacs) is employed so as to play with different SAT solvers on the same model.
