\section{SMT Model}

\subsection{Decision Variables}

Similarly to the SAT model, the SMT model is structured based on its two tasks: \textbf{Satisfiability} and \textbf{Optimization}.

\subsubsection{Satisfiability}

The decision variables for this task are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $match\_schedule_{p,w,m} \in \{\text{true}, \text{false}\}$: true if, and only if, the match $m \in M$ is scheduled for period $p \in P$ of week $w \in W$.
    \item $home_{p,w} = t \in T$: if t is the home team in the match in period $p \in P$ of week $w \in W$.
    \item $away_{p,w} = t \in T$: if t is the away team in the match in period $p \in P$ of week $w \in W$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optimization}
To optimize the balance of the number of games played at home and away for each team, the following variables are utilized:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $flip\_slot_{p,w} \in \{\text{true}, \text{false}\}$: similarly to other models, it defines which team plays at home and which away in the matchup $(t_1, t_2)$ in week w and period p. If the value is false, $t_1$ plays at home, if, instead, it is true, then $t_2$ is the one playing at home.
    
    \item $homeE_{p,w},\, awayE_{p,w} \in T$: are, respectively, the effective home and effective away teams after the slot flip decisions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objective Function}

The optimization goal is to minimize the maximum imbalance $k$ between the number of home and away games played by each team throughout the tournament. Formally,

\[
k^* = \min \big\{\, k \mid \forall t \in T : |H_t - A_t| \leq k \big\}
\]

where:
\[
H_t = \sum_{p,w} \mathbbm{1}[\,homeE_{p,w} = t\,], 
\quad
A_t = \sum_{p,w} \mathbbm{1}[\,awayE_{p,w} = t\,].
\]
The effective home and away variables are computed by considering slot flips:

\begin{align*}
homeE_{p,w} =& \text{ite}(flip\_slot_{p,w},\, away_{p,w},\, home_{p,w}), \\
awayE_{p,w} =& \text{ite}(flip\_slot_{p,w},\, home_{p,w},\, away_{p,w}).
\end{align*}
where ite stands for "if then else" statement.

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Each match is assigned to a unique period each week}

Each period in each week is assigned to exactly one match:

\[
\forall p \in P,\, w \in W: 
\sum_{m \in M} match\_schedule_{p,w,m} = 1.
\]
Each match is assigned to exactly one period each week:

\[
\forall m \in M,\, w \in W: 
\sum_{p \in P} match\_schedule_{p,w,m} = 1.
\]

\subsubsection{Binding team assignments}
The teams playing in the scheduled matches in $match\_schedule$ are linked to the corresponding variables $home$ and $away$ based on the values of $rb$ as follows:

\[
\forall p \in P,\, w \in W: 
\bigvee_{m \in M} \big(
match\_schedule_{p,w,m} \wedge home_{p,w} = rb_{m,w,0} \wedge away_{p,w} = rb_{m,w,1}
\big).
\]

\subsubsection{Every team plays at most twice in the same period}

For each team $t$ and each period $p$, we count how many times $t$ appears either as home or away in that period over all weeks and constraint the count to not exceed 2:

\[
\forall t \in T,\, p \in P: 
\sum_{w \in W} \sum_{m \in M} 
\big(
[\,rb_{m,w,0} = t \lor rb_{m,w,1} = t\,] \cdot [\,match\_schedule_{p,w,m}\,]
\big) \leq 2.
\]

\subsubsection{Symmetry breaking}

To reduce equivalent permutations of the solutions, the first match is fixed:

\[
match\_schedule_{0,0,0} = \text{true}.
\]

\subsection{Validation}

\subsubsection{Experimental design}

The SMT model is implemented in Python using SMT-LIB to interface with Z3 and CVC5 solvers. A two-step approach is followed: first, a feasible schedule satisfying all base constraints is found (\textbf{Satisfiability}); then, a binary search is performed in the range $[1,\, \lfloor(N-1)/2\rfloor]$ to find the minimal imbalance $k$ (\textbf{Optimization}). For each tested value of $k$ in the search, a new \texttt{.smt2} file is generated, resulting in approximately $\log_2(N)$ separate files for the optimization phase, while only one \texttt{.smt2} file is needed for the satisfiability phase. Experiments are run with a time limit of 300 seconds to evaluate solver efficiency and scalability for different instance sizes $N$.


\subsubsection{Experimental results}

The experimental results show that Z3 performs significantly better than CVC5 in terms of solving time and scalability. Specifically, Z3 solved instances up to $N=22$ within the time limit, while CVC5 handled only smaller instances and degraded rapidly beyond $N=8$.
