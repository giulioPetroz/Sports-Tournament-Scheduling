\section{Introduction}
% TODO: add complexity reduction explanation/reference
In this project, we address the sports scheduling (STS) problem by applying a unified modeling approach inspired by \cite{10.1007/10704567_6} across four computational paradigms: Constraint Programming (CP), Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP).
We begin by considering the structure of a round robin tournament: for $N$ teams, the tournament spans $N-1$ weeks, with each week consisting of $\frac{N}{2}$ games (or periods). This structure naturally corresponds to a 1-factorization of the complete graph $K_N$ on $N$ vertices \cite{Dinitz2006RoundRobin}.

A balanced tournament design is a permutation of the order of games within each week satisfying the balancing constraints described in \cite{Lamken2006BalancedTournamentDesigns}. 
Therefore it is natural to model the problem by considering an $\frac{N}{2}\times(N-1)$ matrix of matches representing the round robin tournament for $N$ teams, where each column represents a week and contains the set of matches scheduled for that week.
Our experimental results show that the time required to precompute the underlying round-robin schedule is negligible (less than a second).
Moreover, by precomputing the round robin tournament matrix: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item symmetries across weeks and matchup pairings are removed, reducing the search space
  \item each team plays once a week
  \item each team plays against the other once
\end{itemize}
%we eliminate symmetries across weeks and fix matchup pairings, which significantly reduces the search space for both satisfiability and optimization. Also, thanks to this precomputation techinique, it is guaranteed that the constraints of each team playing once a week and against every other once are satisfied.


\subsection{Notation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N$: number of teams
  \item $T=\{t\ |\ t \in [1, N]\}$: team identifiers
  \item $P=\{p\ |\ p \in [0, ..., \frac{N}{2} - 1]\}$: period identifiers
  \item $M=\{m\ |\ m \in [0, ..., \frac{N}{2} - 1]\}$: weekly matchup identifiers
  \item $W=\{w\ |\ w \in [0, ..., N-2]\}$: week identifiers
  \item $S=\{s\ |\ s \in [0,1]\}$: slot identifiers, where $s=0$ corresponds to playing at home and $s=1$ to playing away
  \item $rb_{m, w, s}=t$: team $t$ plays in week $w$ in match $m$ in slot $s$.
  % \item $m=rb_{p, w}$ is the match $(t_1, t_2)$ in period $p$ of week $w$, where $t_1$ plays at home and $t_2$ plays away
